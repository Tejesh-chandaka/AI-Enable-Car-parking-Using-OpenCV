# AI-enabled car parking using OpenCV 

AI-enabled car parking using OpenCV is a computer vision-based project that aims to automate the parking process. 
The project involves developing an intelligent system that can identify empty parking spaces and gives the count of available parking spots.
The system uses a camera and OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision) library to capture live video footage of the parking lot
